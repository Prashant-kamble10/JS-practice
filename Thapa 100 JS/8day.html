      // Write a function factorial that takes a non-negative integer num as input and returns its factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1.

      // Here are some examples of factorial calculations:
      // factorial(0) => 1
      // factorial(1) => 1
      // factorial(2) => 2
      // factorial(3) => 6
      // factorial(4) => 24
      // factorial(5) => 120
