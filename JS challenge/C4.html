    <!-- Area with Three Side Lengths (Heron's Formula):
     If you know all three side lengths of the triangle (a, b, and c), you can use Heron's formula:

     Area = âˆš[s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)]

    Where s is the semiperimeter of the triangle, calculated as:
    s = (a + b + c) / 2 -->


    <h4>Area of a triangle where three sides are 5, 6, 7 => <span id="ans"></span></h4>

  <script>

    let a = 5;
    let b = 6;
    let c = 7;

    let S = (a + b + c)/2;
    // console.log(S)

    let area = Math.sqrt(S * (S - a) *(S - b) *(S - c));
    console.log("area", area)

    document.getElementById("ans").innerText = area;
